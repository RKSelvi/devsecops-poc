# This workflow checks out code, performs an Anchore container image
# vulnerability and compliance scan, and integrates the results with
# GitHub Advanced Security code scanning feature.  For more information on
# the Anchore scan action usage and parameters, see
# https://github.com/anchore/scan-action.  For more information on
# Anchore container image scanning in general, see
